# Analysis of Amazon Vine Reviews

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to investigate the presence of any positivity bias in the Vine program.

## Data
I analyzed Amazon reviews from a specific product category, consisting of 266 Vine reviews and 38,829 non-Vine reviews. I also analyzed the number and percentage of 5-star Vine and non-Vine reviews.

## The Vine Program
The Vine program is an invitation-only program run by Amazon that provides free products to selected members in exchange for unbiased reviews. Vine members are chosen based on their reviewer rank, which is determined by the helpfulness of their reviews, the number of reviews they have written, and other factors.

## Research Question
I aimed to determine whether Vine reviews were more positive than those written by non-Vine members.

## Methodology
After cleaning the data, I compared the percentage of 5-star Vine reviews (46.992%) to the percentage of 5-star non-Vine reviews (46.990%). I found that there was almost no difference in the percentage of 5-star ratings between Vine and non-Vine reviews.

## Limitations and Implications
While interpreting my findings, I acknowledged potential limitations, such as the size of the dataset and potential confounding variables. However, based on my analysis, I found no conclusive evidence of a significant positivity bias for reviews in the Amazon Vine program. Additional analysis comparing the average star rating of Vine and non-Vine reviews could further support this conclusion.

## Conclusion
Overall, my analysis indicates that there is no significant positivity bias in the Vine program, as both Vine and non-Vine reviews had almost the same percentage of 5-star ratings. This suggests that the Vine program is effective in providing unbiased reviews in exchange for free products.
